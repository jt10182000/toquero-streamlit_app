                Image Classification:
One exciting use of the skills learned in Quantitative Methods is image classification. 
By learning how to preprocess data, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance, I can create systems that accurately classify images. 
For example, I could build a model to identify different types of flowers like roses, sunflowers, lilies, lavenders, and daisies. This shows how theoretical knowledge can solve real-world problems. 
This skill is especially useful in fields like computer vision, agriculture, and environmental monitoring.
                
                Sentiment Analysis:
Another useful application is sentiment analysis, which looks at text data to figure out if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. 
Building sentiment analyzers is very helpful for things like market research, customer feedback, and monitoring social media. 
By using data analysis and natural language processing (NLP), I can create tools that help businesses understand customer feelings and improve their products and services.
